### Project pipeline and team responsibilities

About the authors' contribution, here is how we went ahead and developed the project pipeline.

* A.C.B. and M.B ran extensive research over the Internet to explore modeling approaches and datasets.
* A.M. checked out the initial project steps and assisted in code structure using Generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT and Gemini.
* M.B. and A.M. dealt with the specific code implementation and debugging using Visual Studio Code and assisted by Generative AI tools like Gemini for troubleshooting and best practice suggestions.
* A.C.B. and A.M. collaborated to finalize and wrap up the core modeling code (`Walmart_WeeklySales_Prediction.py`).
* M.B. wrote the comprehensive documentation.
* All team members worked together to ensure the final version of the project was uploaded to the GitHub repository.

### Sources and platforms

The authors of the project acknowledge the following platforms and resources:

* Kaggle.com: this platform has been broadly used to gather the initial dataset (`Walmart_Store_sales.csv`) and access information helpful for project scoping and methodology.
* Generative AI Platforms (ChatGPT/Gemini): these tools were utilized honestly and transparently for initial research, assisting with code structure, and debugging specific programming issues.
